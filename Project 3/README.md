# Project 3

The goal of project 3 was to parse and search a portion of the IMDB database to determine the shortest
path that could connect two actors based on similar movies they appeared in. For example:


Actor A appears in Movie A, Actor B appears in Movie A and Movie B, Actor C appears in Movie B.
So actors A and C are connected via actor B.


The graph was searched with a Breadth First Search to ensure that the sortest path was found.
